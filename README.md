This repository contains a simple, standalone HTML-based calculator for experimenting with substance mixes in the game Schedule 1. It allows you to select a base product, add substances, and see the estimated results, including effects, cost, sell price, profit, and addiction.

This tool is designed for quick, basic experimentation and runs entirely in your web browser locally.

For the most accurate calculations, advanced features (like Reverse calculators, Best mixes database), and the complete set of rules, please use the full online [Schedule 1 Calculator](https://schedule-1-calculator.com/?utm_source=github) ‚¨ÖÔ∏è

## How It Works

This calculator uses data and simplified logic derived from the Schedule 1 game mechanics:

1.  **Select Product:** Choose a base product from the dropdown menu. This sets the initial effects and base price.
2.  **Add Substances:** Drag substances from the "Available Substances" list to the "Selected Mix" list. You can add up to 8 substances.
3.  **Order Substances:** Drag substances within the "Selected Mix" list to change their order. *Note: While you can reorder substances, the simplified logic in this basic calculator doesn't implement the complex, order-dependent rule interactions found in the full game or advanced calculators.*
4.  **Calculate:** Click the "Calculate Mix" button.
5.  **View Results:** The tool calculates:
    * **Cost:** Sum of the prices of the selected substances.
    * **Effects:** Starts with the product's base effects, adds effects from substances (up to 8 total), and applies a *simplified* set of transformation rules.
    * **Sell Price:** Calculated based on the product's base price and the value multiplier of the final effects.
    * **Profit:** Sell Price - Cost.
    * **Profit Margin:** (Profit / Sell Price) * 100.
    * **Addiction:** Sum of the addiction values of the final effects.
